# 100 Days of Code: Python

This is a collection of my own attempts at coding following the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp by Angela Wu on Udemy. 

While most scripts will be rough as I attempt to learn python, as my skills improve I will go back over some of my earlier work in an attempt to clean up the code and optomise it.
